## Project Overview

Problem: US Flight delays â‡’ affecting consumers nationwide and impacting operational costs for airline and airports

Objective: Develop a predictive model that can anticipate flight delays (>15 mins).

## Dataset

There are four datasets used for this project. 
- (1) The first dataset (**Flights Data**) is for flights originating and landing from/to US Domestic airports from 2015 to 2021. 
- (2) The second dataset (**Weather Data**) is for weather information from 2015 to 2021. 
- (3) The third dataset (**Station Data**) is for the weather stations, which contains location and proximity information to help identify the closest weather station to any airport in the first dataset. 
- (4) The fourth dataset (**Airport Code Data**) is for IATA airport code, a three-letter code that is used in passenger reservation, ticketing, and baggage-handling systems. 

There are joined tables (OTPW) using data from all previously mentioned data tables (Airline, weather, sation & AITA). OTPW tables for different time periods are also provided. These consist of 3m, 6m, 1yr and the complete dataset (2015-2019). The total size of the three month OTPW dataset is 1,500,620,247 bytes, with 1,401,363 rows and 216 columns. The total size of the 2015-2019 OTPW dataset is 6,525,616,408 bytes, with 31,673,119 rows and 214 columns.

## Future Work
1. Execution time  
2. Neural Network Implement

## Helpful Information
### Environment
Databrick Notebook
### Transformer Version
Hugging Face updated the Transformers library, to run our code (like BERT) we need to revert to an earlier version of the Transformers library.

!pip install -q transformers==4.37.2
